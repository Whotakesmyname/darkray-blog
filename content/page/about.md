I am Hao Chen, a student, interested in Computer Graphics and game development. This is my personal blog.

You can find me in [GitHub](https://github.com/Whotakesmyname/).

This blog is generated by Hugo and the code is hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/Whotakesmyname/darkray-blog). Deployment is automated with GitHub Actions.

I may prefer to writing technical posts in English and others in Chinese. Chinese posts are tagged.
