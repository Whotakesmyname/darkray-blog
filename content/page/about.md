I am Hrrison Chen, a student. This is my personal blog.

You can find me in [Github](https://github.com/Whotakesmyname/).

This blog is generated by Hugo and the code is hosted in [Github](https://github.com/Whotakesmyname/darkray-blog). Deployment is automated with Github Actions.

Exposing too much personal identity on Internet makes me uncomfortable, so I am afraid that is all of my self introduction.

I may prefer to writing technical posts in English and others in Chinese. Chinese posts are tagged.
